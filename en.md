Society produces a wealth of data and its meaning is often only revealed through thorough evaluation and visualisation. There lies a large untapped potential in the visualisation of complex data. The project "Urban Data Patterns" is at the intersection between Visual Design and Data Science and it's goal is to develop independent concepts for visualising large data sets. The data used in this project provide information about aspects of everyday urban life (e.g. lost property, passengers, air pollution, etc.). This view of the city and its data through the lens of information graphics and programming allow a way of exploration that reveals unusual and novel insights.

Exhibition
The project ist presented in the "Best Form" exhibition of the Bernese Design Foundation from 24 March to 30 April 2017 at the Kornhausforum Berne, Switzerland.
